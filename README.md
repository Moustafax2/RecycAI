# ♻️ RecycAI - AI-Powered Smart Waste Sorting

## Inspiration
Recycling is often confusing due to **inconsistent regulations across cities**, leading to **high contamination rates** in recycling bins. Many people unknowingly **misplace waste**, contributing to **landfill overflow and environmental harm**. We wanted to create a **smart, AI-powered solution** to **simplify waste sorting**, reduce contamination, and promote **sustainable recycling habits**.

## What It Does
RecycAI helps users determine **whether an item is recyclable** based on their **location-specific recycling regulations** by:
- 📸 **Accepting an image of an item** from the user
- 🤖 **Using Google Gemini AI** to analyze and classify the object
- 🌍 **Cross-referencing city-specific recycling rules** to determine if the item is recyclable
- ✅ **Providing instant feedback** on proper waste disposal

## How We Built It
- **Frontend:** Built with **React, HTML, CSS and JavaScript** for an interactive and responsive user interface
- **AI Model:** Integrated **Google Gemini AI** for **real-time image recognition**
- **Deployment:** Hosted the app on **Google Cloud** for scalability

## Challenges We Ran Into
- **Idea Selection Conflict** – We spent nearly **three hours** debating between different AI-powered ideas, including an **animated mental health chatbot** and a **sign language translator for virtual meetings**. We resolved this by **seeking feedback from mentors and other participants**, which helped us choose a **feasible solution within our time constraints**.
- **AI Image Classification Accuracy** – Using **Google Gemini AI 1.5 Flash** for object identification and mapping to recycling rules required extensive **prompt engineering** to improve accuracy.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
- 🏆 Successfully **integrated AI into waste sorting**, making recycling easier for individuals
- 🏆 **Built a functional prototype** in under **24 hours**
- 🏆 Created an **intuitive and user-friendly interface** that simplifies waste disposal

## What We Learned
- 📌 **Effective teamwork** is key—by seeking **external opinions**, we avoided bias and made an informed decision
- 📌 **AI has immense potential in sustainability**—we explored how **machine learning** can be applied to environmental challenges
- 📌 **Time management in hackathons**—we learned to **prioritize core functionalities** to deliver a working solution

## What's Next for RecycAI
⭐ **Public Smart Waste Bins** – Future iterations could introduce **AI-powered smart bins** that use a **mounted camera** (similar to **Ring doorbells**) to **automatically sort waste**

⭐ **Expanded Dataset** – Collect more **detailed recycling data** from additional cities and **international locations**

⭐ **Enhanced AI Accuracy** – Fine-tune the **Google Gemini model** to improve waste classification accuracy

⭐ **Gamification & Incentives** – Develop a **reward system** that encourages users to **recycle properly** by tracking their recycling habits

**With more resources, RecycAI could redefine waste management and make recycling effortless for everyone! 🌍♻️**
